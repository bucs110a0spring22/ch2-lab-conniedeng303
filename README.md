## SUMMARY:
I created the variable classes_per_week, so I can determine the cost per class (cost_per_class). To do this, I divided cost_per_week by classes_per_week. I then printed the value and type of classes_per_week and cst_per_class. Then I printed the value of the cost per week and the cost per class. 

In part B, I created a list of 5 fruits, and then use the random module to pick a random fruit.
